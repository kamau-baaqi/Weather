# "City Time Weather" App

The "City Time Weather" App is a SwiftUI-based iOS application that I developed as a practice project to enhance my skills and explore various concepts. The app provides real-time weather information for multiple cities around the world by fetching data from an external API and displaying the corresponding weather symbols.

## Current Functionality

- Displays a scrollable grid view of cities, each represented by a card.
- Fetches weather data for each city from a remote API.
- Parses the received data to extract the weather symbol.
- Updates the weather symbol in real-time for each city.
- Shows the weather symbol in a visually appealing format within each city card.

## Learning and Practice Goals

The "City Time Weather" App serves as a platform for me to practice and learn more about iOS app development. Through this project, I aim to achieve the following goals:

- Gain proficiency in SwiftUI and its various features.
- Understand how to consume and parse data from remote APIs.
- Improve my skills in handling asynchronous tasks and updating UI in real-time.
- Enhance my knowledge of app architecture and best practices.
- Experiment with different design patterns and user interface techniques.

As I continue to work on the "City Time Weather" App, I intend to explore new ideas, experiment with additional features, and apply the knowledge and skills I gain along the way. This practice app represents my dedication to continuous learning and improvement in iOS development.

## Future Endeavors

While the "City Time Weather" App is primarily a practice project, I may consider expanding it further in the future. I envision exploring additional functionalities, such as detailed weather information, location-based services, search capabilities, and user customization options. These potential enhancements would provide me with valuable learning opportunities and help me grow as an iOS developer.

By practicing and experimenting with the "City Time Weather" App, I am excited to strengthen my skills, gain valuable insights, and ultimately develop more robust and user-friendly applications in the future.
